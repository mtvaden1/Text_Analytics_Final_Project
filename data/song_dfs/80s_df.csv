You
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
How do you want to be remembered?
Just being rich?
Yeah, yeah

Uh
Visions of seeing myself as someone different
Reality got me feeling indifferent
I'm lifting this weight off my shoulder
But hold up, older I get
I reload the clip and sip on something
I feel good for nothing
All my glory days behind me or beyond me
I’m folding like origami
My tables turning like interior decorators
Levels like elevators
These haters got me questioning my judgement
Tried by a jury of my peers, but where the judge went?
What will my legacy be?
Who will my enemy be?
In due time as I write this rhyme
I don't know
Flash before my eyes
Yeah, uh
And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray?
And reminisce of another day, uh
I came from nothing, a child born in poverty
Went to college to gain knowledge
So they would acknowledge me
Honestly, I got a good job
I found a woman, made her my wife
But spent more time at work
So we could have a stable life
And when my son was born
I had to work even harder
Before I knew it, now my wife was giving birth to my daughter
Went fromhours a week to
Ain't nobody gon’ pay me but myself
Sacrifice my time and my health, for wealth
I missed a birthday, miss an anniversary
There's lots of people in this world that's worse than me
I wasn't there for my son's first words
But he ain't grow up in the hood like me, we in the burbs
Sacrifice a couple years, he could have all the money when I'm gone
What a fool I was
I missed his graduation, I missed her wedding day
I didn't even get to give my little girl away
But I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon
I’m not there right now but I will be later
I’m working on something that's greater
That’s my legacy
Uh, I'm gon' be remembered by generations to come
Damn, you dumb
You won't be remembered by your son
Uh, yeah
To be remembered by generations to come
You a fool
You won’t be remembered by your son
""Nonsense, nonsense!""
I said to the man with no money, nonsense, uh, uh
Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity
I look in the mi-look in the mi-the mirror, I ain't clearer
I'm just trying to be free— who is that? It surely ain't me
As I lay on my deathbed, I realized I was wrong
I have been the richest man in the world all along
A beautiful family that all I did was ignore
For financial stability and fear of being poor
'Cause when I was a child, knew I always wanted more
When I was a child, knew I always wanted more, more, more
And now I got it, uh
And now I'm laying in this bed; cancer spreading through my lungs
Looking at my family like ""Damn, y'all were the ones""
I sacrificed my life for 's, 's, 's, 's, 5's, and 1's
So dumb, I'd give it all if I could
Do it for my heart again, not my wallet
I hate to recall it but it's gone now—legacy is gone now
Sacrifice my health for wealth, no, it wasn't worth it
But as I take my last breath, I know that I deserved it

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy
The legacy you gon' leave behind you forever is the blood in your veins
Wake up, Daddy, now is the time for change
And as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change, Daddy
Just as long as we livin'
Just as long as we livin', Daddy
I just want to be happy, I don't give a damn if we live in a shoebox
Now my mama gon' tell you what you got
I love you, I love you, I love you, I want you, I need you, I crave you
Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you?
Why you fucking 'round behind my back
While I'm home raising my children?
Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it
Supposed to be husband and wife, you more like my opponent
Finger fucking myself 'cause fuck infidelity
I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see
Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib
Can I live?
Can I have a life away from my life?
Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife?
You know I love 'em—but if that test wasn't positive
I woulda had a lot to give
Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half
Motherfucker
But I stay 'cause I love these children
And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but
You never there
'Cause you just want to be the best
You just want to make this money, uh
Come get this pussy, motherfucker
Come get this pussy and love your children
Fuck your legacy
Fuck it

Float in the abyss of nothingness
My consciousness remembers a life before it hits black
I wish that I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream
And there's only like four of us on the tour bus
And I'm in the back, how 'bout that?
Thinkin' 'bout my legacy
And how we as human beings sacrifice health for money
Ain't it funny?
'Cause in the end, we spend all our money on repairing our body and mind
When we really should have just spent time

Managed to save just a little bit of money

You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
I quit school and that's what I did

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged

We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

Golden brown, texture like sun
Lays me down, with my mind she runs
Throughout the night, no need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown

Every time, just like the last
On her ship, tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages, she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night

Their shadows searchin' in the night

Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war

Io, non scrivo di getto ma di rigetto
Dio, salvami da questo spettro sotto al letto
Te l'ho detto, io stesso non mi sono mai retto
Ed è una vita che aspetto mentre affetto ogni mio affetto
Affetto da un morbo rancido che vorrei rompere
E raccolgo queste idee per terra con l'aspirapolvere
Per pendere da un lato, perdere ciò che mi hai dato
E prendere il cazzo di lusso di non rispondere
Impronte che ti fanno capire come mi giudico
La gente che continua a vedermi come scorbutico
E l'action-figure di Rancore avrà un opuscolo:
""Strappagli dal petto il cuore, scopri che è minuscolo""
L'unico che fa a gara co' un orologio, ti scoccio
Perché i miei pensieri sono di coccio
Mi concio (Come?) In modo sconcio
E quando passo per strada i manifesti di Silvio mettono il broncio

Can I kick it? No, calci in faccia per gli artisti
Che parlano di
e hanno tatuaggi e piercing
Moralisti, li ho già visti, sono sempre loro questi
I party boy si incazzano se sentono i miei testi
Fanno la faccia seria, poi saltano dalla sedia
Fanno fuoco sopra Kento sopra il forum di Indymedia
Non critico né giudico, ma son fatto di sicuro
Ora vogliono anche i figli ma si amano col culo
Resterò al mio posto e combatto da peso massimo
Scrivendo un testo avendo in testa il prossimo
Mastico veleno, gusto amaro tra le labbra
Talkin' 'bout a revolution come Tracy Chapman
In Condomino la strada è la scuola, figli dei nostri tempi
Si ma non di Ronald McDonald
I mostri sono ancora qui e avverti i vicini
Ogni frame di sto film è un Hall Of Fame per gli Inquilini
Non vede un cazzo, gente senza fede
So sceso all’inferno, i vostri problemi fanno ride'
Il successo, la voglia venale
La mia missione è fa' a pezzi le forze del male
Ecco perché sono sceso sulla tera
Nun me frega un cazzo del rap
Io sto qua pe' fa' la guera
Er nemico è il padrone ed è più grave
Che brigate avanza, una moschea è la mia base
Er punto de non ritorno: questa è la mia vita
Io combatto nel nome della croce greca
Propaganda, esperimenti la vojia a piede libero
A rischio della vita prima linea senza però
Un mondo pieno de creature infernali, vien co' me
Cancello peccati capitali
Nun s'ammazza un fantasma dal passato
Serpe di merda
il tuo volto impagliato

Da Roma come i Flaminio (Sì)
È la nuova scuola, questa volta ospite del Condominio
C'è che vi risulto scomodo
C'è che come al solito la vostra mente è vecchia come un Commodor
Il Condominio lo spinge, la mia voce la conferma
Resta ferma se il gruppo non mi convince
Spinto dalla cattiveria, spinto dalla miseria
Convinto che la faccenda è alquanto seria
Voglio cervelli più aperti, che sta roba vi esalta
Come il commendatore Zampetti
C'ho du mila passioni, le infilo nelle canzoni
E non ci sono paragoni come Trony
Mi immagino a Sanremo con Baudo
Finisce in rissa come il Zequila contro Pappalardo
Polverizzo i tuoi ridicoli idoli

Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride

Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is going to take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more (Can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly, knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing, this girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration so bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting his car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Loose talk in the classroom to hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom the accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her he starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

Spinnin' through the town

And I wind up feelin' down

On a love that burns hot enough to last

Standing in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun, he says, “Get a job”

That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

Said, “Hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do”
Said, “Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?”
He said “Son”

To give those who ain't got a little more

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or lose her
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No, not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

They confused me so

In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap

And don't you hesitate at all – no, no

But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed
