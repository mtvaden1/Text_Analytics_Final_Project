[Trackname: Escapism.] [Artist: RAYE]

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
How I did, how I did, how I did last night

Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)
Other than this 4/4 kick drum poundin' in my head (Mm)

[Trackname: Stick Season] [Artist: Noah Kahan]

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me "forever," now you still can't call me back
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Have to 

[Trackname: Seventeen Going Under] [Artist: Sam Fender]

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist fights on the beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Cryin' like a child
And the boy who kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down

I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

You hurt them like they're nothin'
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You hurt them like they're nothin'
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You hurt them like they're nothin'
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
See, I spent my teens enraged, spirallin' in silence
And I armed myself with a grin
'Cause I was always the fuckin' joker
Buried in their humour amongst the white noise and boys' boys
Locker room talkin' lads' lads
Drenched in cheap drink and snide fags
A mirrored picture of my old man
Oh God, the kid's a dab hand
Canny chanter, but he looks sad
God, the kid looks so sad
And God, the kid looks so sad

She said the debt, the debt, the debt
So I thought about shifting gear
And how she wept and wept and wept
Well, luck came and died 'round here
I see my mother, the DWP see a number
She cries on the floor encumbered

I'm seventeen goin' under
I'm seventeen goin' under
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm seventeen goin' under
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm seventeen goin' under
(Oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm seventeen goin' 

[Trackname: Borderline] [Artist: Tame Impala]

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiven
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
(Comes the sun)
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudi said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable)

And we're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun

[Trackname: Something in the Orange] [Artist: Zach Bryan]

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights

You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

Five days on the freeway, ridin' shotgun with you (Yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fastlane, we had big dreams in blue (Yeah, yeah)
Playin' "Sweet Child of Mine" and I still feel that line
Where are you now? Where are you now?

Lost in these city lights 'cause I can't sleep tonight

When I wake up, I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older, I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)

I just wanna stay for the night, night, night

But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text

(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

It always ends the same
When it was me and you
But every time I meet somebody new
It's like déjà vu (Déjà vu)
I swear they sound the same
It's like they know my skin
Every word they say sounds just like him
And it goes like this

We'll get in your car and you'll lean to kiss me
We'll talk for hours and lie on the backseat
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
And then one random night when everything changes
You won't reply and we'll go back to strangers

It's like déjà vu (It's like déjà vu)
And when we spoke for months
Well, did you ever mean it? (Did you ever mean it?)
How can we say that this is love
When it goes like this?

We'll get in your car and you'll lean to kiss me

[Trackname: Beautiful Things] [Artist: Benson Boone]

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)

I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal

You still make my heart beat fast, Ferrari
With me in the wave, but in the mornin'
Do you still want me?

[Trackname: Lose Control] [Artist: Teddy Swims]

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin and your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah


I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

[Trackname: ceilings] [Artist: Lizzy McAlpine]

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before

[Trackname: Daylight] [Artist: David Kushner]

Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
(Ooh) But I know I might resist it, oh
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same 

[Trackname: As It Was] [Artist: Harry Styles]

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it 

[Trackname: Heaven] [Artist: Niall Horan]

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than this
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

(Heaven won't be the same)

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than, better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control (Even if our love)
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the

Is it too late to pursue?

I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear

If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me

Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
No, you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

I wish I knew

You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me,

[Trackname: Rasputin] [Artist: Majestic]

There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how hе carried on

[Trackname: vampire] [Artist: Olivia Rodrigo]

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart

But they lied about your boy, goin' dumb and it's somethin' idiotic 'bout your boy
She wearin' cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna bе spotted 'round your boy

I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie mе down

All the girls at the barricade (Ayy)
All the girls that been waitin' all day
Let your tongue hang out, fuck everything (Ayy)
If you came with a man (Came with a man)
Let go of his hand (Let go of that shit)

I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

Lately I've been countin' stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's somethin' that I didn't want for you
But I'm steppin' on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love
Lately, I've been wakin' up
In a dreamy state calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long? I guess time just flew

I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of

Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you, mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through

If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming, too

If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happiеr, baby
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until thе morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (Get you off my mind)

We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)
Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)

[Trackname: Fast Car] [Artist: Luke Combs]

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone


You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this

Now I'm in the bathtub cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking
Bubbles in my eyes now
Maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club
Just tryna get a back rub (Lonely)

I'm a sad girl in this big world, it's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened, you're a bad thing

I know I fucked up (Fucked up), I'm just a loser (Loser)
Shouldn't be with ya (With ya), guess I'm a quitter (Quitter)
While you're out there drinkin' (Drinkin'), I'm just here thinkin' (Thinkin')
'Bout where I should've been (Where I should've been)
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah (Woah)

La-la-la-la (Woo), la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Super lonely)

I loathe romancing in itself, yeah, I'd be damned to try
I'm only dancin' by myself, so I don't slam my Irish buck
Compostable cups, B-B-BENEE, I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up, but my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)

[Trackname: Karma] [Artist: Taylor Swift]

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing 

[Trackname: Run] [Artist: OneRepublic]

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Mama said "Son, son, son, son, son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run"

Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yеah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learnеd one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Run, run, run

Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah, yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun
Yeah, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yeah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall

[Trackname: SNAP] [Artist: Rosa Linn]

It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out
So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah

And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap

Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)

One is you make me happy
Two is you set me free
From all the things that held me
Back from just being me
Thank you for all the sweetness
Now I can finally breathe
Now I can finally breathe
But baby, don't you see?

I still get frustrated, I can't lie

And I hate your friends (Your friends)

Movin' out on the floor
You took away the lonely

[Trackname: Forget Me] [Artist: Lewis Capaldi]

Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong

Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even aftеr all, it'd still wreck me
To find out you know how to forget mе
Even after all this time
Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same

Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even after all, it'd still wreck me
To find out you know how to forget me
Even after all this time

I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh (Even after all this time)
I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me, to let you forget me, to let you for—, oh

To find out you know how to forget me

Wanna give myself to you

Boy, you give good love, I won't lie

Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong

[Trackname: august] [Artist: Taylor Swift]

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

[Trackname: Good Days] [Artist: SZA]

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind,

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà

[Trackname: you broke me first] [Artist: Tate McRae]

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

Georgia, wrap me up in all your
I want ya in my arms
Oh, let me hold ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

Georgia pulled me in
I asked to love her once again
You fell, I caught ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say

I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall unless it's you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her

[Trackname: Here With Me] [Artist: d4vd]

Watch the sunrise along the coast
As we're both getting old
I can't describe what I'm feeling
And all I know is we're going home
So, please don't let me go
Don't let me go

And if it's right, I don't care how long it takes
As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears, it'll be okay
All I know is you're here with me

Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh
I can't describe, oh-oh
I wish I could live through every memory again
Just one more time before we float off in the wind
And all the time we spent waiting for the light to take us in
Have been the greatest moments of my life
I don't care how long it takes
As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears, it'll be okay
You're here with me

Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh

[Trackname: Bad Habits] [Artist: Ed Sheeran]

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

[Trackname: Anti-Hero] [Artist: Taylor Swift]

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good

You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed

[Trackname: In The Stars] [Artist: Benson Boone]

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), I'm still holding on
I'm still, ooh, still holding on

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a billion different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in 

[Trackname: Wonder] [Artist: Shawn Mendes]

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them
I wonder, I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by

I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you

I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Trackname: Ghost] [Artist: Justin Bieber]

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Woah

[Trackname: Glimpse of Us] [Artist: Joji]

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch

Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms

[Trackname: Heather] [Artist: Conan Gray]

I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, I wish I were Heather

(Oh)
Wish I were Heather
(Oh, oh)
Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

Enlighten me, my dear(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Why am I still here? Mm (Oh-oh)
I don't mean to be
Complacent with the decisions you made
But why? Mm

In the back of my mind
You died
And I didn't even cry
No, not a single tear
And I'm sick of waiting patiently
For someone that won't even arrive

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh

In the back of my mind
I killed you
And I didn't even regret it
I can't believe I said it
But it's true
I hate you

[Trackname: Eyes Closed] [Artist: Ed Sheeran]

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed

Oh, I keep dancin' with my
They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own

Still dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything

If you keep wondering if somebody understands
Darling, I don't understand you
If you stay awake at night waiting for somebody right
Baby, oh, your karma is due

Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time, like who knew? (Like who knew?)
Music we got into
Songs we fell in love to
Boy, this feels so wrong too
(Ah, ah, ah)

If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
If we ever broke up, I'd call your dad
And tell him all the shittiest of things you've said
If wе ever broke up

Boy, don't gеt emotional
'Cause it's not personal
It's just the way, just the way it goes
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
(Ha-ah, ha-ah)
You're living in Wonderland
If you think I'll understand
All the shit you put me through
If girls in white dresses and big winter weddings
Is something you want to be true (Yeah)
Then pack up your drama, this selfish dilemma
Is something this shit can't undo

Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time like, who knew? Woah

If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ah)

If we ever broke up

Boy, don't get emotional
'Cause it's not personal
It's just the way, just the way it goes
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F you
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F off (F off)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck

Babe, you're too controlling

When you get nasty, back at me
But, baby, don't distract me
I'm a goner, I lost her

I'm a lover, not a fighter
But I'll light this place on fire
I want it, I'm on it
But, babe, at least I'm honest
I get tired of explaining
As these seasons keep on changing
Life goes on and on and on and on and on and

[Trackname: Control] [Artist: Zoe Wees]

Early in the mornin' I still get a little bit nervous
Fightin' my anxiety constantly, I try to control it
Even when I know it's been forever, I can still feel the spin
Hurts when I remember, and I never wanna feel it again

Don't know if you get it 'cause I can't express how thankful I am
That you were always with me when it hurts, I know that you'd understand

I don't wanna lose control
Nothin' I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

Sometimes I still think it's comin', but I know it's not
Tryin' to breathe in and then out, but the air gets caught
'Cause even though I'm older now and I know how to shake off the past
I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have you holdin' my hand

I don't wanna lose control
Nothin' I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest
I don't wanna lose control
I need you to know I would never be this strong without you
You've seen how I grow, you took all my doubts
'Cause you were home

I don't wanna lose control
There's nothin' I can do anymore
I don't wanna lose control (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
Nothin' I can do anymore (Anymore), anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressin' on my chest (Pressin' on my chest)
I don't wanna lose 

[Trackname: Easy On Me] [Artist: Adele]

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on 

[Trackname: Boyfriend] [Artist: Dove Cameron]

I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)

The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do? Not grab your wrist?

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend

I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways hе can't suffice
If I could give you some advicе
I would leave with me tonight
The universe must have divined this (Mmm, mmm)
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend

I never would have left you alone
Here on your own, glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him

Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah

Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
And I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep (Too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me

I'll be honest (Honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense (Oh-oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I don't even know anymore

This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make—

[Trackname: I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE] [Artist: Måneskin]

I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster
'Cause you could be the beauty and I could be the monster
I love you since this morning, not just for aesthetic
I wanna touch your body, so fucking electric
I know you're scared of me, you say that I'm too eccentric
I'm crying all my tears and that's fucking pathetic
I wanna make you hungry, then I wanna feed ya
I wanna paint your face like you're my Mona Lisa
I wanna be a champion, I wanna be a loser
I'll evеn be a clown 'cause I just wanna amuse ya
I wanna bе your sex toy, I wanna be your teacher
I wanna be your sin, I wanna be a preacher
I wanna make you love me, then I wanna leave ya
'Cause, baby, I'm your David and you're my Goliath

Uh-huh
Mhm, uh-huh

Because I'm the devil who's searching for redemption
And I'm a lawyer who's searching for redemption
And I'm a killer who's searching for redemption
A motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption
And I'm a bad guy who's searching for redemption
And I'm a blonde girl who's searching for redemption
And I'm a freak that is searching for redemption
A motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption
I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster
'Cause you can be the beauty and I could be the monster
I wanna make you quiet, I wanna make you nervous
I wanna set you free but I'm too fucking jealous
I wanna pull your strings like you're my Telecaster
And if you want to use me, I could be your puppet

'Cause I'm the devil who's searching for redemption
And I'm a lawyer who's searching for redemption
And I'm a killer who's searching for redemption
A motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption

No
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

All I ever tried to do was help you understand and grow
Light the way for truths that, if not for me, simply wouldn't show
'Less you get somebody else who's on my level, but you know
That there's no one on my level, you gon' realize if you don't
I wish you would own up to your flaws
And just say that you're wrong when you're wrong
Instead of actin' like you're right, then it turns into a fight
Now you stormin' out my house in the middle of the night, I'm tryna-

Breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell mysеlf I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
You're in my hеad like, breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da (Yeah, yeah)

How come when I love somebody, part of me don't wanna stay?
Every time I get too close, I just start pushing them away
I know
I know
Maybe I just wanna leave before they try to leave me first
Maybe I don't wanna need 'em 'til they say they need me first
I know
I know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Drank Tequila, I can't drive home
Hard to play cool, heart belongs to
You, I know that if I show that
I keep my walls up, if you want me, then you better start to climb
Women who love me aren't rare, women who mean it hard to find
Somethin' tells me that I'm right about you, please don't prove me wrong
They say love's a song for fools who are wise enough to sing along

But now it's hard to breathe (Yeah)
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
And now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a thing we make
We're skin on skin, I need this spell to break, oh
But I don't wanna go, and I know that you know
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Da-da-da

(And now it's hard to breathe, into me, I'm into you, breathe, into me)
Are you gon' use me?
Against myself and twist my head, and now she use me
(And now it's hard to breathe, into me, I'm into you, breathe)
I keep my walls up, if you want me, then you better start to climb
Women who love me aren't rare, women who mean it hard to find
I'm tryna (Yeah)

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will

Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)

You ought to know that I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it, no, I don't think we could help it
We don't talk much, guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it, and I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can take

I know you hate it when there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure wе'd fix it, guess we're so usеd to it
Wish I had known this from the beginning
We'd find it hard to work out, why we have all this doubt

If I told you, you'd know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways, we'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same, there's worse things I can

Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night
No point in turning off the lights
Not the same without your head on my shoulders
Growing pains, but I don't wanna get older
Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didn't know that the party was over
And it's true that I need you here closer

Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (Another skin)

I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you

I hopе you're getting evеrything you needed
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that
I couldn't see the forest from the trees
Only time we speak (Only time we speak)
Is in my dreams
Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (Another skin)

I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)

[Trackname: From The Start] [Artist: Laufey]

Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same

Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
"She's so perfect," blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say

That when I talk to you
Oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed staring into the bluе
Unrequited, terrifying
Lovе is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you
Oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the

Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you

I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?

Lеt's take this argument back up to my place (My placе)
Sex remind you I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one (Day one)
We ain't have shit yet, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here
Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important

Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Tried calling yesterday but got your voicemail again
Rushed over to your Uni hall, saw her leaving your place
You said you fucked up on a night out
You drank way too much, you're feeling bad now
You're tryna figure how to worm your way out

Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You've fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
You said it was a one-time thing
You don't know what you were thinking
That it didn't mean a thing
You promise it won't happen again
So when you get fucked up on a night out
How many times have you played around?
Was a fool, didn't see the signs
I guess my friends were always right

Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You've fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends

They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
I can't trust you anymore
Look what you've done
You've turned this heart cold
And I don't know if I can love again
But I know for sure we can't be friends
This is the end

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría

La luna está llena, mi cama vacía

[Trackname: 10 Things I Hate About You] [Artist: Leah Kate]

I caught you cheating
You had the nerve to say you're sleepin', just not with her
But tell your friends that I'll be lost without you
And I'll admit it sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list so I'll never forget all the things I hate about you

Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you

Your friends must suck if they think you're cool
A sloppy drunk obsessed with his Juul
Keep buying bottles with your daddy's money
And I don't know how I fell for your shit
You gross me out, now I've got the ick
And I've got a list of why you don't get to fuck me
Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you

You made me love you
You made me love you
Ooh, oh, how'd you make me love you?
And I'll admit it, sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list, yeah
Ten things I hate about you

Ten, you're selfish

Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' Skim 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright, I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious
I went from the Toyota Yaris to Urus, they had their chance but blew it
Now this gyal wan' me in her uterus, fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (Fuck it)

Take a look at these diamonds wrong, it's a life of squintin', can't just stare

She a feminist, she think I'm sexist
Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta' password, I'll give you the pin to my Amex, huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum
Dinner table, I got manners, huh

Huh, alright, like send the address through, please

Fire for a wife beater, can't rock with that, I ain't wearin' a vest

It's fucked, don't know which one's worse, I'm fucked
Bags in his and hers, what's hers is hers, what's mine is too
Heard that girl is a gold digger, it can't be true if she dated you
AP baby blue, paper's pink, I'd probably hate me too
You ever spent six figures and stared at bae like, "Look what you made me do"?
Yeah, alright, started with a Q, didn't wait in line
Weird, I'm askin' my Blasian one, "Why you so focused on your Asian side?"
I know that the jack boys pray that they get to the clubs and Dave's

[Trackname: Boy's a liar Pt. 2] [Artist: PinkPantheress]

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Thе-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar

Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that it's fat (Damn)
And it been what it been (Huh)
Callin' his phone like, "Yo, send me a pin"
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (Grrah)
But when he hit me, I'm not gon' respond (Grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (Huh)

Don't like sneaky shit that you do (Grrah)

​uoy evol I, sdrow rehto nI
​uoy evol I, sdrow rehto nI

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
Nuff pollution in the ends, I flew back yard cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know dem man talk on the kid, but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

Any girl that I'm datin' knows
Bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
I'll put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know dem man talk on the kid, but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
Nuff girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly-fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace (Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter, Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 's and 's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love

Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever

Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary

On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?

Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life? (My life)

How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day

Somebody tell Doja Cat that I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit, see the bulge in that
See the motion clap when you're throwin' it back (When you're throwin' it back)
These females plannin' on doin' me wrong
So I'm grabbin' a 'dom out the Trojan pack
Post the location after we're gone
Can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you, but I valuе my life (But I value my life)
'Causе imagine I die (Die)
And I ain't made a hundred Ms yet
There's so much things I ain't done yet
Like fuckin' a flight attendant, huh
I don't party, but I heard Cardi there, so fuck it, I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life would've been if I never did take them risks and would have I prospered?
Floatin' and I won't go under
Been outta town for a month
Absence made the love grow fonder
UK rap or UK drill, gotta mention my name if you talk 'bout the genre (Alright)
Ho-ho-how can I be homophobic? (My bitch is gay)
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way (Way)
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day
Ho-ho-how can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay

Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Got that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread (Whip it)
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (Asset)
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (Quavo)

No cap, no pretendin', you don't need mentions (No cap)
Got 'em sayin' "goals," they don't wanna be independent ('Pendent)
Tell them to mind your business (Woo), we in our feelings
It's fifty-fifty percentage (Fifty), attention, we need commitment (Oh)
We gotta both admit it (Both), it's funny, we both listen (Both)
It's a blessing (Blessing) 'cause we both get it (Both)
You the best thing (Woo), and I don't need a witness (Best thing)
I'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (Perfect, perfect, perfect)
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter (No filter)
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer (Oh-oh)
Shower you with all my attention (I will)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (Yeah)
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread (You do)
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (Uh-huh)
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (No mentions)
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Only intentions
That's all I plan to

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish

I am not the type for turning into a detective
Got two of my own phones, barely even check 'em
Uber Eats the food, I don't call, I just text it
Cashed out on bail, my lil' bitch got arrested
Flexed out my Lexus, no backseats and no besties
I chеcked it, no guest list, so don't text mе
Ayy, two pistols, thirties in the clip, these akimbos
Open hand, smack him in his mitt, bitch, I'm Kimbo
You be throwing cash in the strip
My lil' bitch suckin' dick for the free
I got a bitch, but a bitch ain't got me
I know she trip when I dip, so I creep
These bitches pillow talkin' 'bout me like I'm sleep
But she ain't know thiswas in my motherfucking tee
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Propped up, fucking it from the back on an island
Heard they talkin' crazy 'bout my name, now it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back—
