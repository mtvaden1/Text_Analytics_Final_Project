[Trackname: Total Eclipse of the Heart] [Artist: Bonnie Tyler]

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be
(Turn around)
But every now and then, I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight (And I need you)
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight (If you love me)
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right (And we'll never)
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do, I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)
Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Ah-ha, ah-ha)

It doesn't hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna feel how it feels? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God

Oh, come on, baby (Yeah)
Oh, come on, darlin' (Yo)
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'
Let's exchange the experience (Yo, ooh, ooh)
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
With no problems
Say, if I only could

[Trackname: Smalltown Boy] [Artist: Bronski Beat]

To your soul
To your soul
Cry
Cry
Cry

You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
The love that you need will never be found at home

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Oooh)

Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down

And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them, just to your soul
No, you never cried to them, just to your soul
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(Crying to your soul, crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
(Crying to your soul, crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Cry, boy, cry

You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Cry)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

[Trackname: Take My Breath Away - Love Theme from "Top Gun"] [Artist: Berlin]

You
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
How do you want to be remembered?
Just being rich?
Yeah, yeah

Uh
Visions of seeing myself as someone different
Reality got me feeling indifferent
I'm lifting this weight off my shoulder
But hold up, older I get
I reload the clip and sip on something
I feel good for nothing
All my glory days behind me or beyond me
I’m folding like origami
My tables turning like interior decorators
Levels like elevators
These haters got me questioning my judgement
Tried by a jury of my peers, but where the judge went?
What will my legacy be?
Who will my enemy be?
In due time as I write this rhyme
I don't know
Flash before my eyes
Yeah, uh
And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray?
And reminisce of another day, uh
I came from nothing, a child born in poverty
Went to college to gain knowledge
So they would acknowledge me
Honestly, I got a good job
I found a woman, made her my wife
But spent more time at work
So we could have a stable life
And when my son was born
I had to work even harder
Before I knew it, now my wife was giving birth to my daughter
Went fromhours a week to
Ain't nobody gon’ pay me but myself
Sacrifice my time and my health, for wealth
I missed a birthday, miss an anniversary
There's lots of people in this world that's worse than me
I wasn't there for my son's first words
But he ain't grow up in the hood like me, we in the burbs
Sacrifice a couple years, he could have all the money when I'm gone
What a fool I was
I missed his graduation, I missed her wedding day
I didn't even get to give my little girl away
But I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon
I’m not there right now but I will be later
I’m working on something that's greater
That’s my legacy
Uh, I'm gon' be remembered by generations to come
Damn, you dumb
You won't be remembered by your son
Uh, yeah
To be remembered by generations to come
You a fool
You won’t be remembered by your son
"Nonsense, nonsense!"
I said to the man with no money, nonsense, uh, uh
Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity
I look in the mi-look in the mi-the mirror, I ain't clearer
I'm just trying to be free— who is that? It surely ain't me
As I lay on my deathbed, I realized I was wrong
I have been the richest man in the world all along
A beautiful family that all I did was ignore
For financial stability and fear of being poor
'Cause when I was a child, knew I always wanted more
When I was a child, knew I always wanted more, more, more
And now I got it, uh
And now I'm laying in this bed; cancer spreading through my lungs
Looking at my family like "Damn, y'all were the ones"
I sacrificed my life for 's, 's, 's, 's, 5's, and 1's
So dumb, I'd give it all if I could
Do it for my heart again, not my wallet
I hate to recall it but it's gone now—legacy is gone now
Sacrifice my health for wealth, no, it wasn't worth it
But as I take my last breath, I know that I deserved it

Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy
The legacy you gon' leave behind you forever is the blood in your veins
Wake up, Daddy, now is the time for change
And as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change, Daddy
Just as long as we livin'
Just as long as we livin', Daddy
I just want to be happy, I don't give a damn if we live in a shoebox
Now my mama gon' tell you what you got
I love you, I love you, I love you, I want you, I need you, I crave you
Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you?
Why you fucking 'round behind my back
While I'm home raising my children?
Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it
Supposed to be husband and wife, you more like my opponent
Finger fucking myself 'cause fuck infidelity
I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see
Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib
Can I live?
Can I have a life away from my life?
Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife?
You know I love 'em—but if that test wasn't positive
I woulda had a lot to give
Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half
Motherfucker
But I stay 'cause I love these children
And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but
You never there
'Cause you just want to be the best
You just want to make this money, uh
Come get this pussy, motherfucker
Come get this pussy and love your children
Fuck your legacy
Fuck it

Float in the abyss of nothingness
My consciousness remembers a life before it hits black
I wish that I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream
And there's only like four of us on the tour bus
And I'm in the back, how 'bout that?
Thinkin' 'bout my legacy
And how we as human beings sacrifice health for money
Ain't it funny?
'Cause in the end, we spend all our money on repairing our body and mind
When we really should have just spent time
Fuck a legacy
I'ma go live my life


[Trackname: Lay All Your Love On Me] [Artist: ABBA]

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on 

[Trackname: Everybody Wants To Rule The World] [Artist: Tears For Fears]

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the

Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
I'm so glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world


I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the—
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the 

[Trackname: Enjoy the Silence] [Artist: Depeche Mode]

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Trackname: Fast Car] [Artist: Tracy Chapman]

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'

So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this 

[Trackname: With Or Without You] [Artist: U2]

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you

[Trackname: I'm On Fire] [Artist: Bruce Springsteen]

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

(You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you) Well, yeah

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I, I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same

Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) Mm-hmm
You make my dreams come true

Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know

Well, you
Yeah-yeah
You make my dreams come true
Oh, yeah (You, you, you, ooh-ooh-ooh, you)

She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too

It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart

And I'm free
Free fallin'
Yeah, I'm free
Free fallin'

All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free

Yeah, I'm free

[Trackname: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For] [Artist: U2]

I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin'

"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream", she said
"The one that makes me laugh", she said
And threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?", she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like 

[Trackname: Maneater] [Artist: Daryl Hall & John Oates]

She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up

She's a maneater

[Trackname: Dancing In the Dark] [Artist: Bruce Springsteen]

I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Ah, just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, "You gotta stay hungry"
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey, baby


[Trackname: Africa] [Artist: TOTO]


I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, : flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo


"Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo


[Trackname: Never Tear Us Apart] [Artist: INXS]

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I… I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I… (Don't ask me)
I was standing(You know it's true)
Mmm, you were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

You… (Don't ask me)

So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to

[Trackname: You Can Call Me Al] [Artist: Paul Simon]

A man walks down the street
He says, "Why am I soft in the middle, now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard"
Bonedigger, Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away in my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, "Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, whoa, my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my role model is gone, gone?"
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
Call me Al


A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
Call me
Na na na na, na na na na

Golden brown, texture like sun
Lays me down, with my mind she runs
Throughout the night, no need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown

Every time, just like the last
On her ship, tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages, she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown


Never a frown (Never a frown)

What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
When she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of ', oh
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no
Yeah

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

"Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

Buyin' bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said
"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover", yeah

Lyin' in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty"
And he said

"Oh, do you come from a land down under?" Oh yeah, yeah
"Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? Oh
You better run, you better take cover"
'Cause we are living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong


Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss

You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me

Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve, as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing

She'll see I'm not so tough

You know I've seen her in her uptown world

But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been

Everything you say is lies

Things go wrong, they always do

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? (Forever)

[Trackname: Easy Lover] [Artist: Philip Bailey]

Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it

No, you'll never change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh
She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
For she'll say that there's no other
'Til she finds another
Better forget it
Oh, you'll regret it

And don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh, seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh

Now don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
(You'll be down on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see
(Trying to make you see, yeah)
She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it
(Get a hold on you)
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
(You'll be on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
(You won't feel it)
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you, believe it...

[Trackname: 99 Luftballons] [Artist: Nena]


Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
VonLuftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
VonLuftballons
Und, dass sowas von sowas kommt


Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
NurLuftballons

Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
AufLuftballons

 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: „Krieg!“, und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht?
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
WegenLuftballons

WegenLuftballons
Luftballons

Jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh' ich meine Runden
Seh' die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab' 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk' an dich und lass' ihn

[Trackname: Brothers in Arms] [Artist: Dire Straits]


These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms


[Trackname: Talkin' Bout a Revolution] [Artist: Tracy Chapman]


Io, non scrivo di getto ma di rigetto
Dio, salvami da questo spettro sotto al letto
Te l'ho detto, io stesso non mi sono mai retto
Ed è una vita che aspetto mentre affetto ogni mio affetto
Affetto da un morbo rancido che vorrei rompere
E raccolgo queste idee per terra con l'aspirapolvere
Per pendere da un lato, perdere ciò che mi hai dato
E prendere il cazzo di lusso di non rispondere
Impronte che ti fanno capire come mi giudico
La gente che continua a vedermi come scorbutico
E l'action-figure di Rancore avrà un opuscolo:
"Strappagli dal petto il cuore, scopri che è minuscolo"
L'unico che fa a gara co' un orologio, ti scoccio
Perché i miei pensieri sono di coccio
Mi concio (Come?) In modo sconcio
E quando passo per strada i manifesti di Silvio mettono il broncio

Can I kick it? No, calci in faccia per gli artisti
Che parlano di
e hanno tatuaggi e piercing
Moralisti, li ho già visti, sono sempre loro questi
I party boy si incazzano se sentono i miei testi
Fanno la faccia seria, poi saltano dalla sedia
Fanno fuoco sopra Kento sopra il forum di Indymedia
Non critico né giudico, ma son fatto di sicuro
Ora vogliono anche i figli ma si amano col culo
Resterò al mio posto e combatto da peso massimo
Scrivendo un testo avendo in testa il prossimo
Mastico veleno, gusto amaro tra le labbra
Talkin' 'bout a revolution come Tracy Chapman
In Condomino la strada è la scuola, figli dei nostri tempi
Si ma non di Ronald McDonald
I mostri sono ancora qui e avverti i vicini
Ogni frame di sto film è un Hall Of Fame per gli Inquilini
Non vede un cazzo, gente senza fede
So sceso all’inferno, i vostri problemi fanno ride'
Il successo, la voglia venale
La mia missione è fa' a pezzi le forze del male
Ecco perché sono sceso sulla tera
Nun me frega un cazzo del rap
Io sto qua pe' fa' la guera
Er nemico è il padrone ed è più grave
Che brigate avanza, una moschea è la mia base
Er punto de non ritorno: questa è la mia vita
Io combatto nel nome della croce greca
Propaganda, esperimenti la vojia a piede libero
A rischio della vita prima linea senza però
Un mondo pieno de creature infernali, vien co' me
Cancello peccati capitali
Nun s'ammazza un fantasma dal passato
Serpe di merda
il tuo volto impagliato

Da Roma come i Flaminio (Sì)
È la nuova scuola, questa volta ospite del Condominio
C'è che vi risulto scomodo
C'è che come al solito la vostra mente è vecchia come un Commodor
Il Condominio lo spinge, la mia voce la conferma
Resta ferma se il gruppo non mi convince
Spinto dalla cattiveria, spinto dalla miseria
Convinto che la faccenda è alquanto seria
Voglio cervelli più aperti, che sta roba vi esalta
Come il commendatore Zampetti
C'ho du mila passioni, le infilo nelle canzoni
E non ci sono paragoni come Trony
Mi immagino a Sanremo con Baudo
Finisce in rissa come il Zequila contro Pappalardo
Polverizzo i tuoi ridicoli idoli
Le mie rime per le loro teste sono come spigoli
Don't give a fuck
Lyrical assassin
Don't give a fuck
Lyrical assassin

[Trackname: You Shook Me All Night Long] [Artist: AC/DC]

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night

She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I

Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause

I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round

I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Ooh!

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me where can I find a woman like that?


You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find a woman like that?

[Trackname: Break My Stride] [Artist: Matthew Wilder]

Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride

Oh no, I got to keep on moving

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

[Trackname: Only You] [Artist: Yazoo]

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is going to take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more (Can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew (All I ever knew)
Only

I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of


I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches, or so they say
You gotta keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doing the time

[Trackname: More Than This] [Artist: Roxy Music]

I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing?
As free as the wind
Hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
Ooh, there's nothing

It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night
Who can say where we're going?
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning
More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
No, there's nothing
More than this
Nothing
More than this
More than this

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer


Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

[Trackname: Englishman In New York] [Artist: Sting]

I don't drink coffee, I'll take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun


Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say

Nothing ever slows her down and a mess is not allowed

I remember way back then, when everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time, such a fine time, such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play, simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us, two dreamers

Young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly, knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing, this girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration so bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting his car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Loose talk in the classroom to hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom the accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her he starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Clock strikes upon the hour

Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls

Standing in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun, he says, “Get a job”

That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

Said, “Hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do”
Said, “Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?”
He said “Son”

That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them
Yeah

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

Well, they passed a law in '
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar, no

That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Woah, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Would you open your arms out to me?
We can make love, not war
And live at peace with our hearts

Could drive a man to forsake his lover?

[Trackname: Owner of a Lonely Heart] [Artist: Yes]

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or lose her
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
{Music Video only}
I know
I know
I know
Maybe there's another way to do this
{Music Video - Break}

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No, not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so
(Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
(Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all – no, no
Yow!

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a) Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later, each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
(Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it

If there's anything worth my love, it's worth a fight
We only get one chance
But nothing ties our hands
You're what I want

Nothing I want's

Love's the only thing that keeps me here

You're the reason that I'm hanging on
My heart's staying where my heart belongs

Running away will never make you free
And nothing we sign is any kind of guarantee
I wanna hold you now
I won't hold you down
Shaking the past
Making my breaks
Taking control
That's what it takes

Love's the only thing that keeps me here

Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you, with a fine toothcomb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, huhn huh
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, huhn hah
Making love with each other, huhn hah

That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me

Looking for America
Coming through your schools
I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city on rock and roll

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmie Rodgers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis, the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?


Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Let me hear your heart beat
Let me feel your heart beat
Let me touch your heart beat
'Cause I'm gonna change your heart beat

Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand
And so we're

Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew?
And so we're

Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now (Alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (Alone now)
Just you and me the only sound now

Look at the way (Alone now)
We gotta hide what we're doing
Don't care what they say (Alone now)
We're making the only sound now
Can't you hear my heart beat?
Can't you hear my heart beat?
Dancing to my heart beat
Let me hear your heart beat
Let me feel your heart beat
Let me touch your heart beat
Cause I'm gonna change your heart beat

Every time I look into your loving eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby

Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it
Baby
Anything you want (You got it)
Anything you need (You got it)

[Trackname: Born in the U.S.A.] [Artist: Bruce Springsteen]

Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up, now
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
Born in the U.S.A. now
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A.​

Come back home to the refinery
Hirin' man says, “Son, if it was up to me”
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, “Son, don't you understand,” now
Oh yeah
No, no
No, no, no

I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fightin' off them Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burnin' down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.​
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A.​
Born in the U.S.A.​
Born in the U.S.A.​
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A.

Oh, thinkin' about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
Yeah, love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, yeah

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

Oh, and I ride

Ooh, I'm a cowboy

I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all

'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse, I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

I got the night on my side

[Trackname: Don't Worry Be Happy] [Artist: Bobby McFerrin]

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry
Be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry
Be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
But don't worry
Be happy, look at me, I'm happy
Don't worry, be happy (Hey, I'll give you my phone number, when you worry, call me, I'll make you happy)
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry
Be happy
'Cause when you worry, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry
Be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
But don't worry
Be happy, be happy now
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass, whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried

One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color
Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look

She's got the look

What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look
Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
And kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look

She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look

What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?

[Trackname: The Winner Takes It All] [Artist: ABBA]

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)
