Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone
How come I'd never hear you say, "I just wanna be with you"?
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)

Und Lil Jon
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Was geht, Süße?)
Los geht's

Bin im Club mit meinen Homies
Auf der Suche nach Sex, ohne Aufsehen zu erregen (Erregen)
Denn du weißt, wie es ist (Hey, hey)
Ich hab' diе Süße gesehеn, sie hat mich abgecheckt
Bei der Art, wie sie mir ins Ohr geflüstert hat, könnte man meinen, dass sie mich kennt (Kennt)
Ich hab' beschlossen, ruhig zu bleiben (Okay)
Die Unterhaltung wurde lauter (Hey)
Und ich hatte das Gefühl, sie ist bereit mir einen zu blasen
Pass auf! (Oh)
Pass auf!
Sie hat gesagt: „Komm, fang mich“ (Komm, fang mich)
Also bin ich aufgestanden und ihr auf die Tanzfläche gefolgt
Sie meinte: „Baby, los geht's“ (Los geht's)
Und in dem Moment hab' ich's ihr gesagt, ich meinte
Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte
Yeah, yeah
Dass sie und meine Freundin früher mal beste Freundinnen waren
Yeah, yeah
Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere: Sie war auf mir und schrie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Jetzt schwirrt sie mir die ganze Zeit im Kopf rum
Sodass ich denke, es wär 'ne gute Idee, sie mit zu mir zu nehmen (Zu nehmen)
Denn sie ist bereit zu gehen (Bereit zu gehen; oh, los geht's)
Und jetzt muss ich ganz ehrlich sein (Ja)
Auf einer Skala von 1 bisist sie locker 'ne
Aber das bin ich einfach nicht (Hey)
Denn ich weiß nicht, wenn ich mein Glück versuche
Wohin das am Ende führt
Aber was ich weiß: Die Art, wie die sie tanzt
Macht die Süße in meinen Augen perfekt (Hey, hey, hey)
Wie sie runtergeht
Ich denk' mir so: „Ja, genauso kannst du das für mich auch machen“
Sie wollte noch eine Runde tanzen
Und ich so: „Ja, wie zur Hölle könnte ich jetzt gehen?“ Und ich meinte (Los geht's, bring den Beat zurück)
Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey, Luda)

Schau hin, mein Outfit ist lächerlich
Im Club bin ich nicht zu übersehen
Und roar, diese Frauen sind alle auf Beutezug
Wenn du den Kopf still hältst, werd' ich die Kuh melken (Yeah)
Und vergiss das ganze Gelaber, jetzt mein' ich's ernst (Was?)
Ich werd' nicht aufhören, bis sie vor mir ist, wie Gott sie schuf (Yeah)
Also gib mir den Rhythmus und die Klamotten werden fliegen
Dann beug' ich dich nach vorne über und berühr' deine Zehen
Ich hab' den Jaguar stehen lassen und den Rolls-Royce genommen
Wenn sie nicht mit zu mir kommen, sollen sie eben zu Fuß gehen (Los geht's, oh!)
Was hältst du jetzt von mir
Wenn allein mein Ringfinger über . wert ist?
Lass uns trinken, ich versuch' es dir recht zu machen (Yeah)
Ludacris füllt Gläser/Körbe wie Doppel-D (Yeah)
Ich und Usher sind zurück und hinterlassen nichts als Asche
Wir wollen eine, die draußen elegant ist, aber ein Freak im Bett und schreit
Yeah, yeah
Die Süße ist tief nach unten und meinte: „Komm und fang mich“
Yeah, yeah
Ich war so perplex, ich hab' vergessen, dass sie meinte
Yeah, yeah
Dass sie und meine Freundin früher mal beste Freundinnen waren

Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere: Sie war auf mir und schrie

Lil Jon hat den Beat gebaut, der deinen Arsch wackeln lässt

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Catch me, I'm falling down
Catch me, I'm falling down

Don't stop, just keep going on
I'm your shoulder, lean upon
So come on, deliver from inside
All we got is tonight, that is right 'till first light

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one
Is it real now?

Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawlin' on your knees toward it
Makin' Mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Told you how I used to be

Would you go along with someone like me?

I did before and had my share
It didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you

Who you were hanging with

Talking 'bout the young style

Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you
Usually when things has gone this far
People tend to disappear
No one will surprise me unless you do
I can tell there's something going on
Hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving I'm still with you

I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes, it seems the goin' is just too rough
And things go wrong, no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone, you are my daily need, oh
When friends are gone, I know my saviour's love is real
You know it's real

You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love
'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love

Time after time, I think, "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"
Time after time, I think it's just no good
Sooner or later in life, the things you love, you lose
But you've got the love I need to see me through

You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love

Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick

Chest now

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep, Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my—?

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble, Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine

Morning to wake you is all we got
But to know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they won

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion of one billion day funeral

I'm coming up only to show you down for
And coming up only to show you wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves they own the lawn

Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind

One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on

Soft lips are open

With what's to transpire
Hot as a fever
Rattlin' bones

If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Trackname: Clocks] [Artist: Coldplay]

The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are

And nothin' else compares
Oh, nothin' else compares
And nothin' else compares

You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are) home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are) home, where I wanted to 

[Trackname: Human] [Artist: The Killers]

I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

Cut the cord

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've got to let me go

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
You've got to let me know

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know

Don't move, time is slow

Well, I say you don't know

We get it on most every night
When that moon is big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight

He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things

But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait

He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen, and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeah

[Trackname: Beautiful Day] [Artist: U2]

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful 

[Trackname: Chasing Cars] [Artist: Snow Patrol]

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
Let's waste time
Chasin' cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turn me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walkin' out that door
Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles

And see people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turn me off

So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said

A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out
Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
No, no, no, she don't think straight
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light
And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wait for you on the other side
And if you feel (And if you feel)

We will wait for you on the other side

[Trackname: Snow (Hey Oh)] [Artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers]

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh
(Oh)

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and— Hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh
(Oh)

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
Ho!

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa-whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

(Uh-uh) I said, hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now
(Uh-uh) Hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

(Uh-uh) I said, hey— Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now

Oh, yeah!

[Trackname: When You Were Young] [Artist: The Killers]

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)

When you were young
I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo, in so much space, mmm
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mm-hmm
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

A falling star fell from your heart
And landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud as it tore through them
And now, it's left me blind

The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped and I was in the darkness
So darkness I became

The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I took the stars from my eyes and then I made a map
And knew that, somehow, I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you

The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
The stars (The stars), the moon (The moon)
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark (You left me in the dark)
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart (In the shadow of your)

This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue


Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for (Oh, oh-oh)
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for (Oh-oh)
In time I want to be your best friend (Oh-oh)
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-

[Trackname: Bulletproof] [Artist: La Roux]

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
(This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time)
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
(This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time)

[Trackname: Animal] [Artist: Miike Snow]

There was a time when my world was filled with
Darkness, darkness, darkness
Then I stopped dreaming, now I'm supposed to fill it up
With something, something, something
In your eyes, I see the eyes of somebody I knew before
Long, long, long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up?

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah, I slip, I'm still an animal

There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with
Money, money, money
But it gets bigger 'til your hopes is always
Running, running, running
In your eyes, I see the eyes of somebody who could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up?
I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah, I slip, I'm still an animal
I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah, I slip, I'm still an animal


I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah, I slip, I'm still an animal
I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah, I slip, I'm still an 

[Trackname: Better Together] [Artist: Jack Johnson]

There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
And I when, and when I wake up
You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better 

[Trackname: Starlight] [Artist: Muse]

Far away
This ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
And our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
And our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away

And our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations, yeah
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms
I just wanted to

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
(Aah) And your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you

[Trackname: Sing] [Artist: Travis]

Baby, you've been going so crazy
Lately, nothing seems to be going right
Solo, why do you have to get so low
You're so...
You've been waiting in the sun too long

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Colder, crying over your shoulder
Hold her, and tell her everything's gonna be fine
Surely, you've been going too early
Hurry, cause no one's gonna be stopped
No,no,no,no

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Baby, there's something going on today
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
So, na na na na
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
Oh baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, 

[Trackname: I Miss You] [Artist: blink-182]

I miss you, I miss you

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)


Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling is just so right
As we dance by the moonlight
Can't you see you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Trackname: Hey There Delilah] [Artist: Plain White T's]

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Cool, I spend my time just thinking
Thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up, it used to, used to be just me and you

I spend my time just thinking, thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up yo, what's up, what's up

Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe and all the other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself, myself to take me where you be

'Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown, town I travel downtown
Wanna have you around, 'round like every single day
I love you always, ways I'll meet you halfway

Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline

I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

I can't go any further than this

I want you so bad, it's my only wish
Let's cross the bridge to the other side
Just you and I (Just you and I)
I will fly, fly the skies
For you and I (For you and I)
I will try until I die
For you and I (For you and I)
For, for, for you and I
For, for, for, for you and I
For, for you and I (For you and I)

Let it never be said
The romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head
There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in-between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you and me?
Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you with me?

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?

[Trackname: You Found Me] [Artist: The Fray]

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything"
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Well, in the end
Everyone ends up alone
But losin' her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Early mornin'
The city breaks
But I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Takin' all I want
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?

Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

Her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

Man, I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walkin' over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you

Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'..

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry, you don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you, and tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions, no, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails, heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessin' at numbers and figures, pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me, oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails, comin' back as we are

Nobody said it was easy, oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be so hard
I'm goin' back to the start

What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana

On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"

Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .
Just another way to survive

A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Trackname: Unwritten] [Artist: Natasha Bedingfield]

I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending: unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines, yeah, yeah
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Woah
Ooh, oh, woah
Oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Trackname: Waiting On the World to Change] [Artist: John Mayer]

One, two
One, two, three

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change


And we're still waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now we keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

Woo-hoo, yee-hoo
Woo-hoo, yee-hoo
Woo-hoo, yee-hoo
Woo-hoo, yee-hoo

If I could escape, I would
But first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me, boy, now, wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape, sweet escape)
(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)
I wanna get away (Get away) to our sweet escape (Sweet escape)
(Woo-hoo, yee-hoo, woo-hoo, yee-hoo)
I wanna get away (Get away), yeah (Yeah)

You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me, boy, now, wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape, sweet escape)

[Trackname: Somewhere Only We Know] [Artist: Keane]

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go? So why don't we go?

Ooh
Oh

This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go somewhere only we know?

[Trackname: Best of You] [Artist: Foo Fighters]

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you? Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you? 

[Trackname: Seven Nation Army] [Artist: The White Stripes]

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette

And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone"

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, "Find a home"


I'm goin' to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more

And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home"

[Trackname: Californication] [Artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers]

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station??
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Trackname: Fix You] [Artist: Coldplay]

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose somethin' you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix

One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)

For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

I wake up every evenin'
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels outta place
And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Yeah, do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow, you'll be thinkin' to yourself
"Yeah, where did it all go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no, you'll never tell (No, you'll never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
(Hope it gives you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through

Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marchin' in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished makin' sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinnin' me, it's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender? Oh

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrorin' your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Paranoia is in bloom, the PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious

They will stop degrading us

That and this, these and those

How they stick in your throat
Tastes like gold
Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I, I

I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow
I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
And come undone
Pleasantly cavin' in
I come undone
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I, I

What a gift here below
But no one knows
A gift that you give to me
No one knows

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will

I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son
I don't have to be anyone other
Than a birth of two souls in one

Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me, ah

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that
You're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a drivin' ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?


Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and starin' at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feelin' in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah
'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here

Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pullin' in and givin' her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezin'
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, goin' out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh

Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan

[Trackname: Butterfly] [Artist: Crazy Town]

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Trackname: The Man Who Can't Be Moved] [Artist: The Script]

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year"
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh
There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (oh, where on Earth I could be)
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet, oh, oh)

By the way, I tried to say

Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Black jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line

She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending every day

Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

And she will be loved
And she will bе loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

Doesn't matter anymore

You come any time you want, yeah

She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't wanna get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

You're aching, you're breaking

Says everybody's changing and I don't know why

So little time

I'm trying to stay awake and remember my name

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

Oh, the wind whistles down the cold, dark street tonight
And the people, they were dancin' to the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy, tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs, they get louder, each one better than before

And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

So you're headin' down the road in your taxi for four
And you're waitin' outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in, and nobody's home till four
So you're sittin' there with nothin' to do
Talkin' about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go, and where you gonna sleep tonight
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?

[Trackname: American Boy] [Artist: Estelle]

This a number one champion sound (Yeah)
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down (Get down)
Who the hottest in the world right now? (Uh)
Just touched down in London town (Uh)
Bet they give me a pound (Uh)
Tell 'em put the money in my hand right now (Yes)
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
I just met this 5-foot guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
La, la la, la la, eya
Will you be my American boy? American boy

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, maybe then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers lookin' fresh to death, I'm lovin' those Shell Toes
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
Tell 'em wah gwan, blud!
Who killin' them in the UK?
Everybody gonna say, "You, K"
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, "Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now."
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinkin'
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer? Uh
Dressed smart like a London bloke (Yeah)
Before he speak his suit bespoke (Woop)
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke (Woo)
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lotta wags wanna hear it
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love? (Ooh)
Would you be my American boy? American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day (Ooh, someday)
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay (I wanna see the Bay)
I really want to (You) come kick it with you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day (I'd like to go some day)

[Trackname: Grace Kelly] [Artist: MIKA]

I wanna talk to you
The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears
I promise you it won't happen again

Do I attract you? Do I repulse you
With my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?
I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome
Guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me
Without makin' me try?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly (Mm)
But all her looks were too sad (Ah)
So I tried a little Freddie (Mm)
I've gone identity mad

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door?
Getting angry doesn't solve anything

How can I help it? How can I help it?
How can I help what you think?
Hello, my baby, hello, my baby
Putting my life on the brink
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
Just to be put on your shelf?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly (Mm)
But all her looks were too sad (Ah)
So I tried a little Freddie (Mm)
I've gone identity mad

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door
Say what you want to satisfy yourself, hey
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
You want

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door
I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door

Ooh, oh

[Trackname: New Shoes] [Artist: Paolo Nutini]

Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
Then I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
The room full of all o' my friends all dancing round and round
And I thought: Hello, new shoes, bye-bye blues
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn
Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Oh hey, I put some new shoes on

[Trackname: Tears Dry On Their Own] [Artist: Amy Winehouse]


All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears 

[Trackname: Shake It] [Artist: Metro Station]

Let’s drop!
Yeah, come on
Shake, shake

I'll take you home if you don't leave me at the front door
Your body's cold, but girl, we're getting so warm
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside

Tonight, you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

Your lips tremble, but your eyes are in a straight stare
We're on the bed, but your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide
Tonight you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
And I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time
But I was thinking of ways to get you staying the night
Your body's shaking, tell me off so I can turn off the lights

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

[Trackname: This Love] [Artist: Maroon 5]

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said goodbye too many times before (Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me (Yeah)
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before

Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands

Set sail from sense, bring all her young
Set sail from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait

A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

But one last time let's go there

I'm going to make it bend and break

In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so
Great, "He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter"

Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball...
It's always cloudy except for (Except for...)
When you look into the past (Look into the past...)
One night stand...
One night stand off!
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so
Great, "He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter," oh-oh

They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, woah

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so
Great, "He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter," oh-oh-oh-oh
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so
Great, "He tastes like you, only sweeter," oh-oh-oh

The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under ('Stead of goin' under)
'Stead of goin' under


I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

Instead of goin' under again
Instead of goin' under, 'stead of goin' under again
'Stead of goin' under again ('Stead of goin' under again)

[Trackname: Hung Up] [Artist: Madonna]

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing, every little thing

Oh, well, imagine as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear, no, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:
"What a beautiful wedding! What a beautiful wedding!" says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore"

I chimed in with a, "Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality
I chimed in, "Haven't you people ever heard of closing a goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of...

Oh, well, in fact, well, I'll look at it this way: I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne

One, two, three, four, tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights, that is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing, but they want some more

Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

Sweetheart, bitter heart, now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

Oh, oh-oh, you're changin' your heart
Oh, oh-oh, you know who you are

One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason

Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on (We got a special kinda thing)
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry (Uh, uh, yeah)
I apologize a trillion times
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song, let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real (Your mom a bitch)
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

[Trackname: Wherever You Will Go] [Artist: The Calling]

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will

Say it right, say it all

You either stand, or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

Oh, you could mean everything to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body (From my body), I could show you (I could show you)

Anything you want to hear

Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dyin' to be him?

All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down, don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there?
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothin' to hide
On and on, I got nothin' to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Then I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded
To telling only lies
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

To be mistreated
To be defeated

And no one knows how to say
That they're sorry
And don't worry
I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

Go out and smash it, like, "Oh my God!"
Jump off that sofa, let's kick it off (I feel)

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losin' all control (I feel)
Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancin', just take it off (I feel)
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again (I feel)
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, and do it, and do it, let's live it up (I feel)

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock
Easy come, easy go, now we on top (I feel)
Fill the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop
'Round and 'round, up and down, around the clock (I feel)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (Do it)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (Do it)
Get-get-get-get-get with us, you know what we say (Say)
Party every day, pa-pa-pa-party every day

[Trackname: Savior] [Artist: Rise Against]

It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?
So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know
That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

I don't hate you
I don't hate you
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

I wake up everyday, it's a daydream
Everything in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just living my life
There's nothing crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man, I'm just living my life
There's nothing crazy about me

Bonkers

[Trackname: Broken Strings] [Artist: James Morrison]

Let me hold you for the last time
It's the last chance to feel again
But you broke me, now I can't feel anything
When "I love you" rings so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When I'm speaking it's the voice of someone else

Oh, it tears me up
I tried to hold on, but it hurts too much
I tried to forgive, but it's not enough
To make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real
Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?

Oh, what are we doing?
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us
Running back through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When it's too late, too late
Oh, it tears me up
I tried to hold on, but it hurts too much
I tried to forgive, but it's not enough
To make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real
Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?

But we're running through the fire
When there's nothing left to save
It's like chasing the very last train
When we both know it's too late, too late

You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart don't want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real
Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse
So how can I give anymore
When I love you a little less than before?
Oh, you know that I love you a little less than before
Let me hold you for the last time
It's the last chance to feel 

[Trackname: Put Your Records On] [Artist: Corinne Bailey Rae]

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes
We've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Girl)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

'Twas more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Baby, ooh!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Uh, let your hair down)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams (Hope you get your dreams)
Just go ahead, let your hair down (Baby, let your hair down)

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah, oh, go)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Hey, hey)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams (Sapphire faded jeans)
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Ooh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere,

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change (Yeah)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
(Yeah, yeah)

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man, he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh-oh

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Took it to my stash spot,State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say "What up?" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse—don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien
In New York (Ayy, ow, uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

What'd you do that for? (What'd you do that for?)
When you first left me
I didn't know what to say (Say)
I never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feelin' alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back (Want me back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack (It don't mean jack)
No, it don't mean jack (No, it don't mean jack)

[Trackname: Pure Shores] [Artist: All Saints]

I've crossed the deserts for miles
Swam water for time
Searching places to find
A piece of something to call mine (I'm coming)
(I'm coming) A piece of something to call mine (I'm coming)
(Coming closer to you)
Went along many moors
Walked through many doors
The place where I wanna be
Is the place I can call mine (I'm coming)
(I'm coming) Is the place I can call mine (I'm coming)
(Coming closer to you)

I'm moving, I'm coming
Can you hear what I hear?
It's calling you, my dear
Out of reach (Take me to my beach)
I can hear it calling you
I'm coming, not drowning
Swimming closer to you

Ooh-ooh
Never been here before
I'm intrigued, I'm unsure
I'm searching for more
I've got something that's all mine
I've got something that's all mine
Take me somewhere I can breathe
I've got so much to see
This is where I want to be
In a place I can call mine
In a place I can call mine

I'm moving, I'm coming
Can you hear what I hear?
It's calling you, my dear
Out of reach (Take me to my beach)
I can hear it calling you

Swimming closer to you

Moving, coming
Can you hear what I hear, hear it out of reach?
I hear it calling you
Swimming closer to you
Many faces I have seen
Many places I have been
Walked the deserts, swam the shores (Coming closer to you)
Many faces I have known
Many ways in which I've grown
Moving closer on my own (Coming closer to you)

I move it, I feel it
I'm coming, not drowning
I move it, I feel it
I'm coming, not drowning

I'm moving, I'm coming
Can you hear what I hear?
It's calling you, my dear
Out of reach (Take me to my beach)
I can hear it calling you

Swimming closer to you

He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

I love you much, it's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black

[Trackname: Your Body Is a Wonderland] [Artist: John Mayer]

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)

Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind! (Whoo!)
Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Let's go!

(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

Get 'em Jay!

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations
Can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the , it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to

Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given
I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don't understand

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste

I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her
Scare myself to death
That's why I keep on running
Before I've arrived
I can see myself coming
I just wanna feel real love
Filll the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste
And I need to feel real love
And a life ever after
I can not get enough


I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
I got too much love
Running through my veins
To go to waste

I just wanna feel real love
And a life ever after
There's a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face
It's a real big place

Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given

Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

The way she feels inside (Inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (Deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (Won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this line back

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

[Trackname: Where Is The Love?] [Artist: Black Eyed Peas]

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)

Stormin' through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' "act your age"

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me
To let you know when
Don't count on me
I'll do it again
Don't count on me
It's the point you're missin'
Don't count on me
'Cause I'm not listenin'

Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

(Waste my time with them)
Casualty of society
(Waste my time with them)
Victim of your conformity and back

[Trackname: I Don't Feel Like Dancin'] [Artist: Scissor Sisters]

Wake up in the morning with a head like, "What ya done?"
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
