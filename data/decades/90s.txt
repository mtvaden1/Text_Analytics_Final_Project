Oh

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Well, a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a deadbeat ass, so
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time

If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh, yes, son, I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh, yes, son, I'm talkin' to you (Baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh, yes, son, I'm talkin' to you
Wanna get with me with no money, oh no

[Trackname: Torn] [Artist: Natalie Imbruglia]

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should've seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins, and now

I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn
Oh

[Trackname: You Get What You Give] [Artist: New Radicals]

One, two!
One, two, three, ow!

Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frienemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)
You feel your dreams are dying, hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby
You're tops
Give it to me now!
Four A.M., we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke, but hey, we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (Friend)
You feel your tree is breaking, just bend

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

This whole damn world could fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
Don't let go, I feel the music in you
You, you, you
Fly high, high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
Don't give up, just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance, rip-off flying
FDA, big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson (Don't give up)
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in

Don't let go, one dance left
Don't give up, can't forget
Don't let 

[Trackname: Bitch] [Artist: Meredith Brooks]

I hate the world today
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other

The curtains
'Cause all we need

You and me
And a bottle of wine
Gonna hold you tonight
Uh, yeah

Well, we know
I'm going away
And how I wish
I wish it weren't so
So, take this wine
And drink with me
Let's delay our misery

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
There's a log
On the fire
And it burns
Like me for you
Tomorrow comes
With one desire
To take me away
Oh, it's true

It ain't easy
To say goodbye
Darling, please
Don't start to cry
'Cause, girl, you know I've got to go

And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow

But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
Da-da-da-da
She's so high, high above me

First class and fancy-free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be
Why should I even bother?
A-ah

High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite

Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view

Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

And all I could taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

We are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright

Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright

Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean

Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo

You can never be lonely

Paint myself in blue and red, and black, and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that

Fuck...

Another turnin' point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right

Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well, me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes? I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way?
Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman

Well, separate my side

Slittin' my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside

Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She want to know am I still a slut?
I gotta take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for the soul mate bled
Mmm, push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the otherside

Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side

A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever


Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside

I tear it down, I tear it down, and then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side

[Trackname: Friday I'm in Love] [Artist: The Cure]

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love


Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown and just smile at the sound
As sleek as a sheik, spinning round and round
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love, woah

Oh, do-do, do-do, do-do, do

[Trackname: Slide] [Artist: The Goo Goo Dolls]

Could you whisper in my ear?
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anything
To feel it comin'
Do you wake up on your own
Or wonder where you are?
And live with all your faults

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?
Yeah, we're gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
I don't suppose I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
Or something I can just change
I live around it

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Ooh, slide
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?

Ooh-oo, oohoo

And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married
Or run away?

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything
(Yeah, slide)
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete

Little pieces of the nothing that fall

And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete

Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Ohh ohh, oh May

Yeah, slide between the sheets
Of all them beds you never knew

Why don't you slide into my room
Just slide into my room
And ah we'll run away
Run away, run 

[Trackname: Learn to Fly] [Artist: Foo Fighters]

Run and tell all of the angels, this could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution, 'cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die

Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of lyin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

I think I'm done nursin' the patience, it can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's all right

Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to

Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to
Lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to...

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Trackname: Loser] [Artist: Beck]

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Happiness, more or less
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, watch my fever growing
I know just where I am

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

Well, I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness, something in my own place
I'm stood here naked, smiling, I feel no disgrace

No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)

If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?


And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?

You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember that film
And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."
And I said "Well, that's the one thing we've got."

I see you - the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
So what now? It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

Oh, life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now, I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just dream

That's me in the corner

You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry


Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

Brother Pele's in the back, sweet Sina's in the front
Cruising down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, "Please step out onto the line"
Pele preaches words of comfort, Sina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, "Is that a Chevy '?"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks "righteous," Sister Sina says, "funky"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
Ringmaster steps out, says, "The elephants left town"
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, "We're out of here," Sina says, "Right on"
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy, headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)

Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero

You've got your ball, you got your chain
Tied to me tight, tie me up again
Who's got their claws in you my friend?
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll
Lost for you, I'm so lost, for you

Oh, when you come
Crash into me
And I come into you
And I come into you
In a boy's dream, in a boy's dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare boned, and crazy for you

Oh, when you come
Crash into me
Yeah, baby, when I come into you
In a boy's dream, a boys dream
If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
To forgive me for my haste
When I'm holding you so girl
Close to me
And you come
Crash into me, baby
And I come into you

Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
A boy's dream, in a boys dream
Oh I watch you there
Through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
Wear it so well
Tied up and twisted
The way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash
Into me
Baby, come crash into me, yeah
Crash into me
Crash into me
Oh, you know
I'm king of the castle
You're my dirty rascal
Crash into me
Please crash into me baby
We both know
See the way, come crash into me
See the way you come rash into me
Crash into me

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head

What's in your head, in your head?

[Trackname: Enjoy the Silence] [Artist: Depeche Mode]

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted

[Trackname: Hallelujah] [Artist: Jeff Buckley]

Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Trackname: What's My Age Again?] [Artist: blink-182]

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again?)
(What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes,the confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall

Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes, pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle, puts the glory out to hide, hide

Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Oh, why

Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs

[Trackname: One Headlight] [Artist: The Wallflowers]

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, "It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade"
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight


Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it, baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone
And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue
And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again

Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)
Coming down (Learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)

Well, some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there
I'm learning to fly around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Trackname: Self Esteem] [Artist: The Offspring]

La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh, I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so
Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem
Oh, way, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care

You could put some joy upon my face
Oh, sunshine in an empty place

Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go, each time I hear you say

Won't you teach me how to love and learn
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn

I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me, no reason to repent
I know you wanna say it

See if you can spot this one

What will you do when you get lonely
No one waiting by your side?
You've been running, hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Tried to give you consolation
Your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don’t say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Trackname: If It Makes You Happy] [Artist: Sheryl Crow]

I've been a long
A long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down
Real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again
Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far
Far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in-between

Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

While she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
Why, I can't remember anything to this very day

You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though
You're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die
Both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I gotta stop pretending
Who we are

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Do you believe in life after love?

Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that

I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
(I'd appreciate your input)

Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means "Small Craft Advisory"
So if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time," you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X-Files"

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now


You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me
And I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry"

Well, this ain't over

Not while I still need you around
You don't owe me

Like I'm a little untrustin'
When I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"

Well, well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
Yeah, well, I can't change, oh
Well, I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around

You gave me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before


You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking by the way I feel

And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on

[Trackname: Ordinary World] [Artist: Duran Duran]

Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognise?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
(Just blown away)

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
Every world

[Trackname: All Star] [Artist: Smash Mouth]

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (W-w-wacko)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(All that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shooting stars…

Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place"
I said, "Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change"
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)

[Trackname: Angels] [Artist: Robbie Williams]

I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead


And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels

[Trackname: Here With Me] [Artist: Dido]

I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

Don't want to call my friends
For they might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been
Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave

[Trackname: I Love You Always Forever] [Artist: Donna Lewis]

Feels like
I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists
Of pale amber rose
Feels like
I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching
Discovering you

Those days
Of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Summer night, summer night air
Secret moments
Shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again

I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything (say it, say it again)
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything
I will do for you
You've got
The most unbelievable blue eyes
I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say it, say it again

I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together
Everywhere
I will be with you
Everything (say it, say it again)
I will do for you
I love you
Always, forever
Near and far
Closer together

I will be with you

When we were young, the future was so bright (Woah)
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah)
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah)
The kids are grown up, but their lives are worn (Woah)
How can one little street swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

Jamie had a chance, well, she really did (Woah)
Instead, she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (Woah)
He just plays guitar, smokes a lot of pot
And Jay committed suicide (Woah)
And Brandon OD'd and died (Woah)
What the hell is goin' on?
The cruelest dream, reality
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still, it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found

I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep
(I need to sleep)
Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light, Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear.. Insomnia..
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, Something's all over me
Greasy insomnia, Please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight
From the mental movement
So when it's black, This insomniac takes an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep..
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep...

At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street

Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar
And the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well, there's a small boat made of china
It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well, do I lie like a lounge-room lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this
Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss?
Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?
Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight
Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night
Now I hate to leave you bare
If you need me I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down
Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane
And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane
And I called your name
My cocaine...
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

[Trackname: Common People - Full Length Version] [Artist: Pulp]

She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her Dad was loaded
I said "In that case, I'll have rum and Coca-Cola"
She said "fine"
And then in thirty seconds time she said

"I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
Wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people like you."
Well,​ what else could I do?
I said "I'll... I'll see what I can do"

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said, "Pretend you got no money"
And she just laughed and said, "Oh, you're so funny"
I said, "Yeah...
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here"
Are you sure"
You wanna live like common people
You wanna see whatever common people see
Wanna sleep with common people
You wanna sleep with common people like me?
But she didn’t understand
And she just smiled and held my hand

Oh, rent a flat above a shop
And cut your hair and get a job
And smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what ever common people do
Never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
Oh!

Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along, even though they're, they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool
Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out, they'll tear your insides out
'Cause everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who, who thinks it's all such a laugh
Yeah, and the chip stains and grease will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why

Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
And smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah
Never live like common people
Never do what common people do
Never fail like common people
Never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do," but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to 

[Trackname: Walkin' On The Sun] [Artist: Smash Mouth]

It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression, and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound, some were hell-bound, some, they fell down
And some got back up and fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove, yeah

And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name callin' me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turnin' of the world so soft and slow
Turnin' you round and round
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it, yeah

I was born long ago
I am the chosen, I'm the one
I have come to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid, I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know
Are you going to go my way?
Because baby I got to know,

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh
(Ooh, ooh)
Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up

Am I just paranoid?

This is the David Bowie's song

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
Wе walked a million hills
I must have died alonе
A long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

In a church, by the face
He talks about the people going under
Only child know

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you, my friend, and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)

Crazy yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no
If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak
But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit

Oh darlin'
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy
In a world full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, crazy
In a heaven of people there's only some who want to fly
Ain't that crazy, oh babe, oh darlin'
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy, isn't that crazy

Oh, but we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little (crazy)
No, no we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little bit

The size of which you've never known before
They'll break it
Someday, only child know
Them things

I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
"Get back together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'

Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will

Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"

I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)

East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet

Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?

[Trackname: Drinking in L.A.] [Artist: Bran Van 3000]

Hi, my name is Stereo Mike
Yeah, we got three tickets to the Bran Van concert happening this Monday night at the Pacific Palisades
Now, you can all call in if you, uh, want to answer a couple of questions
Uh, mainly, "What is Todd's favorite cheese?"
Uh, Jackie just called in and said it was a form of Roquefort
Let's see about that
Give us a ring-a-ding-ding
It's a beautiful day
(Who are you?, Who are you?)
Yeah, Todd, this is Liquid, ring-a-ding-dinging
I want those three Bran Van tickets, man
(Who are you?, Who are you?)
What do you need? Todd?
(He’s alive! Alive!)
(Todd?)

I woke up again this morning with the sun in my eyes
When Mike came over with a script surprise
A mafioso story with a twist
A To Wong Fu, Julie Newmar Hitch
"Get your ass out of bed," he said, "I'll explain it on the way"
But we did nothing, absolutely nothing that day
And I say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at twenty-six?
I got the fever for the flavor
The payback will be later
Still I need a fix
(Yeah, uh-huh, mic, please)

And the girls on the bus kept laughing at us
As we rode on thedown to Venice again
Blaring out the G-funk, sipping on juice and gin
Just me and a friend
Feeling kind of groovy, workin' on a movie
(Yeah, right!)

But we did nothing, absolutely bupkis that day
And I'll say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at twenty-six?
With my mind on my money and my money on my- (BEER!)
I know that life is for the taking, so I better wise up and take it quick
Yeah, one more time at Trader Vic’s

Well some men there wanted to hurt us
And other men said we weren't worth the fuss
You could see 'em all bitching by the bar
About the fine line between the rich and the poor
Then Mike turned to me and said, "What you think we got done, son?"
We found the conclusion, and I guess that's something
So I ask you, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at twenty-six?
I got the fever for the nectar
The payback will be later
Still I need a fix
(Need to fix you up)
(Call me up one day, and maybe we'll fix it all up)

Hell-A, L.A
Hell-Hell-A, L.A
Hell-A, L.A
Hell-Hell-A, L.A
Hell-A, L.A
Hell-Hell-A
So I ask you what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at twenty-six?

(He’s alive! Alive!)
(Yeah, mighty thirsty, I reckon)
L.A

She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
"Oh, what a morning"
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get ya

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah

(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)
So, if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get ya

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is another baby, yeah)

[Trackname: Ode To My Family] [Artist: The Cranberries]

Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?
Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?

You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido, the bank, and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive

[Trackname: Miami] [Artist: Will Smith]


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, "Hi, Will!"
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, "Will, we loved your last hit!"
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay, papi!"
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home (Miami)
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Oh, oh

What I got, you got to give it to your mamma
What I got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got, you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with Sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper


Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper


What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world wants wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a thirteen, but they drew a thirty-one
Friends say he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way, for you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
The world loves wannabes, ah
Let's get some more wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

Running things to keep my swing (All night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack (There it is)

You know that I'll be back (Here I go)

You know that I'll be back (Round and round)
Ahh, Mark, stop lying about your big break
For God sake, I need a real man, uh
(The return of the mack, aoww) stop letting me down
Stop letting me down

You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Put on a little Dylan
Sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherit a million bucks
And when she died it came to me

I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
Then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah
The Dolphins make me cry
But there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with

[Trackname: Life Is A Highway] [Artist: Tom Cochrane]

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long, hmm
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Oh


There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah)
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long, ooh
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah

[Trackname: Groove Is in the Heart] [Artist: Deee-Lite]

(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance)
(We're going to dance and have some fun)

Dig!

The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)
I couldn't ask for another (Uh huh, uh huh)
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (Astronomical)
Groove is in the heart
(Hit me!)
(Watch out!)

The depth of hula groove
Moves us to the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another

Some looks in this torso (Uh, yeah)
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know (wanna know)
Delightful, truly delightful (lightful)
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show (show)
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze (haze)
Music makes motion, moves like a maze (maze)
All inside of me, heart especially (side, yeah)
Hilt of the rhythm, where I wanna be (c'mon)
Flowin', glowin' with electric eyes (eyes)
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize (yeah)
Baby, you see the funky side of me
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key (yeah)
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it, can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the stoop when I hear a funk loop (bloop)
Playin' Pied Piper, follow what's true
Baby, just sing about the groove!
(Sing it!)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart (na na na na na)
Groove is in the heart

(One, two, three)
(Blulululu!!)

Blow them horns along
(The groove is in your heart)

Groove is in the heart (yeah)
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart

Hmmmmm
He he he he
C'mon, y'all deep
Y'all are crazy,
